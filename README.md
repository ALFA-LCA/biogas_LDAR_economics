# Biogas methane leak data and LDAR payback time

## Leak data combination
The tool loads data collected from literature on leak of different plant parts from an Excel file and combines it with the excellent data from a paper from Bakkaloglu et al. 2022 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2022.05.012).

It draws the distributions for all available plant parts and is able to add the values assumed in the RED II default values as comparison.

## Leak detection and repair (LDAR) payback time
Based on data collected through a questionnaire to experts on detection costs and repair costs, a Monte Carlo analysis is carried out to calculate the costs of an LDAR programme compared to the increase in revenue if the methane that is not lost anymore is sold.

The cost data is sparse, so there is a high uncertainty here, but the outcome shows that a high share of repairs have payback times below 10 years. Unsurprisingly, plants with leak rates above 10% have very short payback times. As detection costs are only a small part of the overall LDAR costs, this means that it is in the interest of the operator to execute a regular leak detection, and repair the leaks if a certain leak rate to repair cost ratio is given.
